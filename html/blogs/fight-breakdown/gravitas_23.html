                <h2>Gravitas'23: Unveiling the Robowar Spectacle</h2>
                <h7>Published on October 05, 2023</h7>
                
        <p>The Vellore Institute of Technology's annual tech fest, Gravitas, is renowned for hosting an array of thrilling competitions and events. Among them, the Robowar event always stands out as a true test of engineering prowess and innovation. This year, DOT Robotics, a passionate team of young engineers, participated in the under 15Kg category with two formidable bots named Loki and Atheera. Join us on a thrilling journey as we recount our ups and downs during this unforgettable competition.</p>

        <h4>Round 1: Atheera's Dramatic Start</h4>
        <p>Atheera, our first contender, faced Synergy in the opening round. For the first 1 minute and 30 seconds, everything went according to plan. However, disaster struck as one side of Atheera's drive malfunctioned, causing it to perform an unintended crab walk. Post-match inspection revealed that the motors had come out of the gearbox due to excessive vibration and improper mounting. Additionally, the gears of the planetary gearbox were worn out, making quick repairs impossible. Unfortunately, Atheera had to bow out of the competition, ending its journey prematurely.</p>

        <h4>Round 1 for Loki: Overtime Woes</h4>
        <p>Next up was Loki, ready to take on Sunya Kratos. Our team had meticulously tested the bot, ensuring that everything was in working order. However, in the final minutes before the match, Loki encountered power issues. While we frantically tried to resolve the problem, the judging panel had no choice but to disqualify us due to the overtime taken to rectify the issue.</p>

        <h4>Double Elimination Drama</h4>
        <p>Despite the setbacks, DOT Robotics wasn't ready to throw in the towel. After resolving the issues, Loki was back in action. The double elimination format gave us another chance, and we were determined to make the most of it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Loki vs. Mag:</strong> Loki emerged victorious as Mag decided to quit the match.</p>
        <p><strong>Loki vs. Vulcan:</strong> A thrilling contest ensued, with both bots demonstrating exceptional drive and performance. In the end, Loki secured a win by knockout.</p>
        <p><strong>Loki vs. Mr. Gator:</strong> Our opponent, Mr. Gator, faced technical issues with their bot and had to withdraw from the competition.</p>

        <h4>A Fierce Battle: Loki vs. T-Rex</h4>
        <p>As Loki advanced through the rounds, it faced increasingly formidable opponents. In the fifth round, we found ourselves pitted against T-Rex from Team Terrorbull Robotics. The match was intense, with both bots performing admirably. In the middle of the contest, T-Rex struck Loki's weapon pulley, disabling our weapon system. However, our skilled driver managed to keep Loki in the fight, using its spinning speed to disable T-Rex's weapon and inflict damage to its rear plates.</p>
        
        <p>Unfortunately, the match ended with Loki getting stuck in the arena, leading to our bot's immobilization. T-Rex emerged victorious, but it was a hard-fought battle that left a lasting impression.</p>

        <h4>Lessons Learned and Future Plans</h4>
        <p>Participating in Gravitas'23 was a valuable experience for DOT Robotics. We learned a great deal from our fellow competitors, including DS Robotics, Terrorbull Robotics, Tufan Samal, VisionBotz, Team Orcus, and Team Gladiator. Their knowledge and sportsmanship enriched our journey.</p>
        
        <p>Looking ahead, our team is determined to make improvements. We plan to upgrade our drive with a brushless setup, aiming to enhance our bots' performance and reliability. Gravitas'23 has left us with unforgettable memories, a deeper understanding of robotics, and the motivation to come back stronger next time.</p>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>The Gravitas'23 Robowar event at VIT, Vellore, was a rollercoaster ride for DOT Robotics. Despite the initial setbacks, our bots Loki and Atheera displayed resilience, determination, and impressive performance. We are grateful to the Gravitas team for their support, even during adverse weather conditions. As we continue to learn and grow, we look forward to future challenges and opportunities to showcase our passion for robotics.</p>
