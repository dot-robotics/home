                    <h4>Pre-Match</h4>
                    <p>
                        In the nail-biting lead-up to the semi-finals, our bot, Honey Badger, faced its fair share of challenges despite emerging victorious. The intense battle left us with some battle scars, including damages to the front and loose mounting hole threads, not to mention a bent skid. With the clock ticking and the finals looming, we knew immediate action was necessary. With just around three hours to spare, we made the tough decision to disassemble the entire body to address the issues head-on. However, a stubborn obstacle stood in our way as we struggled to remove broken fasteners.</p>

                    <p> It was at this critical juncture that we received an unexpected lifeline from the generous assistance of <span>Team Visionbotz</span> and the invaluable guidance of <span>Mr. Tufan Samal</span>. Their expertise and willingness to lend a hand not only helped us overcome the obstacles but also provided us with alternative ideas for mounting the skid. Thanks to their timely intervention and unwavering support, we were able to restore Honey Badger to top-notch condition, ready to face the finals with confidence and determination.</p>

                    
                    <h4>Battle Begins</h4>

                    <p>In the climactic showdown of the finals, our formidable opponent was none other than Team Gladiator. The match kicked off with both bots exchanging blows, but it quickly became apparent that their hits lacked the desired impact. Seizing the opportunity, Honey Badger unleashed its own barrage of attacks, gradually gaining the upper hand. A decisive head-on collision dealt a crippling blow to Gladiator's weapon, tipping the scales decisively in our favor.</p>
                    
                    <p>As the match progressed, Gladiator resorted to desperate tactics, attempting to slam us against the arena walls in a bid to disable our weapon. However, our team remained steadfast, skillfully maneuvering to evade their onslaught and maintain control of the match. With victory seemingly within our grasp, a sudden setback occurred as one of our drive motors faltered in the final moments of the bout.</p>

                    <p>Despite this last-minute hurdle, Honey Badger's relentless performance throughout the match secured us a commanding lead in points. As the tense 10-second countdown began, our hearts raced with anticipation. In a thrilling conclusion, the final buzzer sounded, and based on the accumulated points, Honey Badger emerged triumphant, securing a hard-fought victory against Team Gladiator and clinching the championship title.</p>

                    <h4>Post-Match</h4>
                    <p>In the aftermath of the thrilling finals, we were overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from our dedicated fans and fellow competitors. The unwavering encouragement from <span>VIT Chennai</span> and the <span>NHCE people's</span> buoyed our spirits throughout the intense competition. We extend our heartfelt appreciation to the esteemed judging panel, comprised of <span>Mr. Sujan Shetty</span> and <span>Mr. Tufan Samal</span>, whose professionalism and meticulous attention ensured a fair and competitive environment for all participants. The <span>QuantumX Team's</span> immaculately organized facilities provided us with ample time and resources to repair and fine-tune our bot, contributing significantly to our success on the battlefield.</p>
